# Landbot Backend Challenge

## Description

The product department wants a system to be notified when a customer requests assistance from a bot. The bot will make an http call (like a webhook) with the following information:

- Topic: a string with values can be sales or pricing
- Description: a string with a description of the problem that needs assistance from.

You need to expose an API endpoint that will receive this call and depending on the selected topic will forward it to a different channel:

``` 
Topic    | Channel   
----------------------
Sales    | Slack
Pricing  | Email
```

## Notes:
- Slack and Email are suggestions. Select one channel that you like the most, the other can be a mock.
- There may be more topics and channels in the future.

## The solution should:
- Be written in your favorite language and with the tools with which you feel comfortable.
- Be coded as you do daily (libraries, style, testing...).
- Be easy to grow with new functionality.
- Be a dockerized app.


## Howto

# Running
There's a Makefile to do common tasks

Start project
```bash
make up
```
It starts a fastapi server at  http://0.0.0.0:8000

Also there's a `make up-d` to start docker compose at background

Stop the project
```bash
make down
```

There's a shell quick access executing 
```
make shell
```
